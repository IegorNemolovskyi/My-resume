            <p><span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</span> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> and <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">JavaScript</span>, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">World Wide Web</span>.</p>
            <p>Web browsers receive <span style="color: #009B21; background-color:#FFFF00">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> pages. With <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img /> and < input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as < p > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

            <img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg/170px-Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg" alt="Photograph of Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009">
            <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">CERN</span>, proposed and prototyped <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">ENQUIRE</span>, a system for <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">CERN</span> researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">CERN</span>. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
            <p>The first publicly available description of <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span>. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</span>-based documentation format at <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">CERN</span>. Eleven of these elements still exist in <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML 4</span>.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">CSS</span>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">SGML</span>, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">RUNOFF</span> command developed in the early 1960s for the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System)</span> operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">SGML</span> concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup</p>
            <p>Berners-Lee considered <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> to be an application of <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">SGML</span>. It was formally defined as such by the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</span> with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">SGML</span> Document type definition to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">NCSA</span> Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">IETF</span>'s philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.</p>
            <p>After the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> and <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML+</span> drafts expired in early 1994, the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">IETF</span> created an <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.</p>
            <p>Further development under the auspices of the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">IETF</span> was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</span>. However, in 2000, <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML</span> also became an international standard (<span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">ISO/IEC 15445:2000</span>). <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML 4.01</span> was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">HTML5</span> in the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</span>, which became a joint deliverable with the <span style="color: #009B21; background-color: #FFFF00">W3C</span> in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</p>

          <h2>HTML versions timeline</h2>
          <h3>November 24, 1995</h3>
          <p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
            <li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
            <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
            <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>January 14, 1997</h3>
          <p>HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996. Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>
          <h3>December 18, 1997</h3>
          <p>HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
            <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
            <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.</p>
          <h3>April 24, 1998</h3>
          <p>HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</p>
          <h3>December 24, 1999</h3>
          <p>HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.</p>
          <h3>May 2000</h3>
          <p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).</p>
          <p>After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.</p>
          <h3>October 28, 2014</h3>
          <p>HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
          <h3>November 1, 2016</h3>
          <p>HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
          <h3>December 14, 2017</h3>
          <p>HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
